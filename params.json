It tracks the energy level of the enemy and when there is a small drop in energy it assumes the enemy just fired a bullet so Pikachu changes its direction.  \r\n\r\n**Targeting:** Pikachu uses its radar to scan for the enemy robot. It continually oscillates the radar so it can continually track the enemy.  \r\n\r\n**Firing** Pikachu uses its radar to calculate where the enemy is and aims its gun at the enemy. Pikachu then fires a bullet at the enemy with power based on the distance of the enemy. The further the enemy from Pikachu, the weaker the power of the bullet fired.\r\n\r\n##About the project\r\nFor more details on this project, see:\r\n* [User Guide](https://github.com/kcanida/robocode-kkc-pikachu/wiki/User-Guide)\r\n* [Developer Guide](https://github.com/kcanida/robocode-kkc-pikachu/wiki/Developer-Guide)\r\n* [Contact Us](https://github.com/kcanida/robocode-kkc-pikachu/wiki/Contact-Us)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
